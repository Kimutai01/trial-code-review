      <p id="tribute-info">
        Albert Einstein was born in Ulm, in the Kingdom of WÃ¼rttemberg in the
        German Empire, on 14 March 1879 into a family of secular Ashkenazi
        Jews.His parents were Hermann Einstein, a salesman and engineer, and
        Pauline Koch. In 1880, the family moved to Munich, where Einstein's
        father and his uncle Jakob founded Elektrotechnische Fabrik J.
        Einstein & Cie, a company that manufactured electrical equipment based
        on direct current. Albert attended a Catholic elementary school in
        Munich, from the age of five, for three years. At the age of eight, he
        was transferred to the Luitpold Gymnasium (now known as the Albert
        Einstein Gymnasium), where he received advanced primary and secondary
        school education until he left the German Empire seven years later. In
        1894, Hermann and Jakob's company lost a bid to supply the city of
        Munich with electrical lighting because they lacked the capital to
        convert their equipment from the direct current (DC) standard to the
        more efficient alternating current (AC) standard.The loss forced the
        sale of the Munich factory. In search of business, the Einstein family
        moved to Italy, first to Milan and a few months later to Pavia. When
        the family moved to Pavia, Einstein, then 15, stayed in Munich to
        finish his studies at the Luitpold Gymnasium. His father intended for
        him to pursue electrical engineering, but Einstein clashed with the
        authorities and resented the school's regimen and teaching method. He
        later wrote that the spirit of learning and creative thought was lost
        in strict rote learning. At the end of December 1894, he traveled to
        Italy to join his family in Pavia, convincing the school to let him go
        by using a doctor's note.During his time in Italy he wrote a short
        essay with the title "On the Investigation of the State of the Ether
        in a Magnetic Field". He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in
        1901.
